	<h1>00 - Prologue</h1>
	<p>The night was soundless, save for the rushed footsteps of a young man. His sneakers tapped on the gray pavement. Tall, slender lightposts bent over him as he ran past, emitting a soft orange glow. The colorful Hawaiian shirt he wore hanged weightily in the humid air of the wetlands.</p>
	<p>The boy looked up at the road ahead. It seemed to stretch on forever. The wetlands would always sit to the right side of the road. Likewise, the left side would always be occupied by the black river of the Baz. And the line of lightposts stacked up so neatly it was almost hypnotizing. </p>
	<p>No matter how fast ran, he knew that he would never make it very far. But that didn't matter to him. All he wanted was to leave, to run away from the fate patiently waiting for him at that cursed hotel. He would much rather die before seeing himself fall victim to such prospects.</p>
	<p>His pace quickened. It quickened some more. He flew by the orderly lightposts, screaming to anyone who would listen.</p>
	<p>Only death could answer.</p>
	<p>The next moment, the boy fell dead on the pavement.</p>
	<p><i>"To the next of you, Blood of Eni,"</i> spoke a large man. He approached the corpse, adorned in a freshly ironed, coal-black trenchcoat. His eyes, masked by the shadow of his fedora, peered through wiry spectacles at the body. His demeanor was calm, but his tone was one of dissapointment. Deep, crimson blood from the deceased pooled at his ink-black derby shoes. "Let us pray to the gods that you don't make the same mistakes as your predecessor."</p>
	<p>Dipping his black, leather-gloved hand into his coat, the man produced a small glass vial. Bending down, he filled it with the blood of the corpse. Applying a lid to the vial, the contained substance shifted to a golden hue and began to spin, as if it was a tiny, gilded hurricane.</p>
	<p>"To the next of you, Niles, I offer the Blood of Eni," said the man, returning the vial to his coat.</p>
	<p><i>"Don't let us down."</i></p>
	<p>And with that, the man began his trek back in the direction he came. Yet unknown to him, the corpse he abandoned would stand, coughing masses of ink-black blood.</p>
